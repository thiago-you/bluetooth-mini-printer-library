# Bluetooth Mini Printer Library
This library is an updated and compiled implementation from the one [Joonik Team](https://github.com/Joonik/BlueToothDEMO) has ported with a lot of effort. The original app was designed for eclipse and comes bundled with the printer.

This new implementation is designed to Android Studio and are using the library "androidx" to work better on android newer versions. It has a much simpler interface and UTF-8/ISO-8859-1 (Latin) charset compatibility.

### DEMO
You can use the activities under demo folder to quickly test the library and have a example to your own implementation. An demo implementation can be found into [demo repository](https://github.com/thiagoyou/bluetooth-mini-printer-demo)
